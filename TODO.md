## General
+ consider using sunday first for US/Canada/Mexico/Australia
  + add that info to pdf filenames
  + needs to be part of i18n somehowâ€¦

## PDF version
+ make sure spiral binding does not ruin title elements

## Landing page
+ improve page layout (laptop/mobile)
+ if applicable: show today's photo with short explanation
  + or if full date given in URL
  + need to add species names for that (i18n!)

## HTML version
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ remove crop marks and bleed
+ able to navigate to next/previous month

## Workflow

## Title bar
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## Hosting
+ free webhosting of several 300mb and 30mb files

## Photos

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
