## General
+ replace tabs in photo_information.txt with commas?
+ observation links in february page still reflect previous photos

## Photos

## PDF version
+ make sure spiral binding does not ruin title elements
+ consider embedding fonts for print shops

## Landing page
+ improve page layout (laptop/mobile)
+ if applicable: show today's photo with short explanation
  + or if full date given in URL
  + need to add species names for that (i18n!)

## HTML version
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ remove crop marks and bleed
+ able to navigate to next/previous month

## Perpetual calendar
+ consider changing qr code #202601 etc. url parameter - implemented simple #MM format for perpetual

## Sunday-first calendar option
+ consider using sunday first for US/Canada/Mexico/Australia
  + add that info to pdf filenames
  + needs to be part of i18n somehowâ€¦
+ add --sunday-first option to build_calendar.py
+ modify week_calculator.py to support Sunday as first day
+ update calendar templates to handle both Monday and Sunday start
+ add language/region support for different week start preferences

## Title page
+ 12 photos with country names
+ title?

## Workflow

## Title bar
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## Hosting
+ free webhosting of several 300mb and 30mb files

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
