## General
+ add i18n (German, Spanish)
+ use full week day names

## Title bar
+ improve QR code UX: user should know they can get more info about the photos there
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## PDF version
+ QR missing after folder structure update
+ page now too high for A3
+ cut marks no longer showing (3mm bleed)
+ leave space for top binding
+ let's get rid of the current "web" resolution and rename "ultra" to "web"

## Landing page
+ "pick other date" problems:
  + only first click works, afterwards closes directly after click
  + layout of date not nice

## HTML version
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ click on image opens observation
+ able to navigate to next/previous month
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ does it end up on github.io? or in .gitignore?

## Photos

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
