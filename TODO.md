## General
+ consider using sunday first for US/Canada/Mexico/Australia

## PDF version
+ make sure spiral binding does not ruin title elements

## Landing page
+ "pick other date" problems:
  + only first click works, afterwards closes directly after click
  + layout of date not nice

## HTML version
+ header broken for some reason
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ does it end up on github.io? or in .gitignore?
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ click on image opens observation
+ able to navigate to next/previous month

## Workflow

## Title bar
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## Hosting
+ free webhosting of several 300mb and 30mb files

## Photos

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
