## General

## PDF version
+ page now too high for A3
+ cut marks no longer showing (3mm bleed)
+ leave space for top binding

## Landing page
+ "pick other date" problems:
  + only first click works, afterwards closes directly after click
  + layout of date not nice

## HTML version
+ photos no longer show
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ click on image opens observation
+ able to navigate to next/previous month
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ does it end up on github.io? or in .gitignore?

## Workflow
+ fix `Created optimized HTML file: output/2026/de/html/202609_pdf_pdf_optimized.html` naming error
+ create "print" and "web" pdf at the same time

## Title bar
+ improve QR code UX: user should know they can get more info about the photos there
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## Photos

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
