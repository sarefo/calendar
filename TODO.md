## General

## PDF version
+ it's okay if the calendar ends up 3mm shorter than A3 on three sides
+ only need to crop at top and left/right
+ probably should extend green to the very edge
+ cut marks no longer showing (3mm bleed)

## Landing page
+ "pick other date" problems:
  + only first click works, afterwards closes directly after click
  + layout of date not nice

## HTML version
+ check if we really need hardcoded html for each language
+ does it end up on github.io? or in .gitignore?
+ website: make calendar html mobile ready
+ click on image opens observation
+ able to navigate to next/previous month

## Workflow

## Title bar
+ improve QR code UX: user should know they can get more info about the photos there
+ consider moving title bar to bottom

## Photos

## World map
+ coordinates are sometimes off, needed to tweak them to the right for some maps
+ we probably don't need to create the maps in the assets folder of each language. use one common folder instead?
